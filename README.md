# Tooltip Navigation Project

This project demonstrates how to create a **tooltip navigation menu** using only HTML and CSS. It is designed to enhance your understanding of CSS positioning, hover effects, and creating visually interactive UI elements without relying on JavaScript. The tooltips appear above navigation items when hovered, with smooth transitions and animations.
